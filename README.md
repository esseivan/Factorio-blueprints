# FactorioBlueprints

Decode and encode blueprints

## Belt converter
Convert all belts type to another type (e.g. level 1 to 3)
Just go in the tab "Convert belt type", select the one to be replaced and by which one to replace
Then click the run button to create a new blueprint
Infos : Fast mode can be enabled in the General tab
It directly copy the clipboard to the encoded part, it decodes, it run the converter, it encode back and finally copy it to clipboard
So you just have to copy the string from factorio, alt tab in the app and directly alt tab back in factorio, the new string is automatically copied in clipboard
Coming soon : add the feature to directly run the converter without even alt-tabbing, just by copying in the clipboard

## Inserter converter
coming soon
