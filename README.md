# FactorioBlueprints

Decode and encode blueprints

## Belt converter
Convert any belts type to another type (e.g. level 1 to 3)
Just go in the "Convert belt type" tab, select the one to be replaced and by which one to replace
Then click the run button to create a new blueprint
Fast mode and express mode can be enabled in the General tab
### Fast mode
Directly run the enabled converters from the clipboard then copy back to clipboard when the app is focused (e.g. by alt-tabbing in)
### Express mode
Directly run the enabled converters from the clipboard when the clipboard is changed (e.g. copying blueprint string from factorio)

## Inserter converter
Same as belt converter but with inserters
